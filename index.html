		<h1>Material</h1>
		<h2>A conference exploring the concept of the Web as a material</h2>
		<p>The Internet and the Web are still very new too us. We don't fully understand them as a material. For centuries we've worked with wood, metal, glass, ceramic, paper, textiles. More recently new materials have emerged; plastics, fiberglass, silicon, and more. We understand their limitations, their affordances. We can fold, heat, manipulate and warp some of these materials.</p>
		<p>What does this mean for the Web? What are the properties of the Web as a Material?</p>

		<p>We have lost the Apprentice/Master relationship in the digital world. Spending years getting our hands dirty with an expert, learning slowly and really understanding the material rather than the framework. We need to be asking ourselves, what sacrifices should we be making for the convinence of our customers rather than shortcuts for ourselves.</p>


		<p>That is what this conference is meant to explore.</p>
		<h2>Fall 02016: Reykjavik, Iceland</h2>
		<p>Nothing has been sorted out yet. We are exploring venues and speakers in the next few months. Shortly after, we'll have a kickstarter campaign to sell tickets.</p>
		<h3>Speakers</h3>
		<p><abbr title="To Be Determined">TBD</abbr>: We are still in the planning phase, but we'd like to bring a mix of people internationally and Icelandic locals.</p>
		<h3>Workshops</h3>
		<p>As something extra, we want to try and organize some small workshops around different materials. For example, a Ceramic studio workshop, Leather craft, Letterpress, etc. These are <abbr title="To Be Determined">TBD</abbr> both when, where and what.</p>
		<h3>Venue</h3>
		<p>We haven't selected a venue, but we have a short-list. They are all in central Reykjavik, easy access from various hotels and guesthouses. More importantly, near plenty of great food and shops.</p>
