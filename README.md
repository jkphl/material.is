The Internet and the Web are still very new to us. We don't fully understand them as a material. For centuries we've worked with wood, metal, glass, ceramic, paper, textiles. More recently, new materials have emerged; plastics, fiberglass, silicon, and more. We understand their limitations, their affordances. We can fold, heat, manipulate and warp some of these materials.

**What does this mean for the Web? What are the properties of the Web as a Material?**

We have lost the Apprentice/Master relationship in the digital world. Spending years getting our hands dirty with an expert, learning slowly and really understanding the material rather than the framework. We need to be asking ourselves what sacrifices should we be making for the convinience of our customers rather than shortcuts for ourselves.

**That is what this conference is meant to explore.**

### Speakers & Venue
Nothing has been sorted out yet. We are exploring venues and speakers in the next few weeks. We'd like to bring a mix of people internationally and Icelandic locals. The venues on our short-list are all in central Reykjavík, easy to access from various hotels and guesthouses. More importantly, near plenty of great food and shops.

### Workshops
As something extra, we want to try and organize some small workshops around different materials. For example, a Ceramic studio workshop, Leather craft, Letterpress, etc. These are TBD both when, where and what.

### Tickets
Once we have settled on a venue and the first bits of a schedule, we'll have a kickstarter campaign to sell tickets. We know that travelling to Iceland for a conference might sound like an adventure — and it is! — so please bear with us while we put together the best experience possible.
