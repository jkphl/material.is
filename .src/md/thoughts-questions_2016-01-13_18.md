Material 2016 January Session
=============================
> Ideas, thoughts & questions

This is a (still incomplete and very unsorted) list of things we should consider when organizing **_Material 2016_**. It's a rough combination of my experience, learnings from my [border:none](https://border-none.net) events and [many](https://gist.github.com/anselmh/819e724a8e513a61837c) [other](https://gist.github.com/doismellburning/6ef44a51df271bca4782) [people's](https://github.com/erikr/lessobviouschecklist) thoughts.

**_Material 2016_** is all about "doing the right thing" on the Web. In that regard, we should always strive for making **_Material 2016_** the most excellent conference experience we can create — not only for the attendees, but also for the speakers, the venue, the team and ourselves.

## General

* The conference must have a well specified name, pronounciation and writing
* The conference should have a strong visual identitiy. This may include but is not limited to
	* a logo
	* a general artwork (corporate design)
	* a website design
	* a design for print stuff like flyers, banners, badges etc.
	* a design for slides (e.g. during the breaks)
	* opening titles (video)

## Documentation / communication

* We always need to make attendees feel welcome
* We need (on the website, on the spot and explicitely announced):
	* a code of conduct
	* an inclusivity & diversity policy
	* an accessibility statement (what exactly can we offer to impaired visitors?)
* We should introduce and establish a hashtag before others do 
* We should monitor that hashtag and social media coverage in general
* Will there be a twitter wall or similar running throughout the conference? Where is it shown?
* Can we provide a backchannel during the talks to discuss them "live"? Or ist this counter-productive (people staring onto their smartphones ...)?
* Regular reminders in the run-up to the conference
	* Monthly(?) newsletter
	* Regular social media postings about speakers, sponsors, etc.
* We should provide location, travel & public transport information
	* How to get from the airport to the partnering hotels
	* How to get to the venue(s)
	* Nice spots for food & drinks around the venues (e.g. Foursquare list)
	* Some important things about Iceland, it's people and culture in general 
	* Information about SIM cards & data plans
* Attendees might prefer not to be photographed during the conference
	* A smart solution to communicate this could be two differently colored lanyards to clearly signalize the attendees' preferences
* We could consider having a [real-time captioner](http://composition.al/blog/2014/05/31/your-next-conference-should-have-real-time-captioning/) and / live [translation to sign language](https://twitter.com/jkphl/status/611832718872215552)
* Don't forget to say thank you to everyone involved at the end of the conference
	* the attendees
	* the speakers
	* the team
	* the sponsors
	* the venue and its staff
	* our families
	* and so on

## Website

* Clearly display the dates and locations of the event
* The website must be easy to use and fully accessible
* The website must provide in an easily usable way
	* the dates and location
	* the schedule
	* the speakers and their talks
	* travel information (if possible including visa information)
	* hotel recommendations

## Tickets & prices

* What is our general price strategy?
	1. Keep ticket prices as low as possible, do without any bells and whistles? 
	2. Aim for a particular price level and see how far we can get with it?
	3. Compose the best possible (reasonably priced) experience and accept the costs for it?
* What are the things we could waive (useless stuff, swag)?
	* Sustainable / reasonable use of all kinds of materials and resources should be our topmost goal anyway
* How can we sufficiently communicate where the attendees' money is going into?
* Ask for some details during ticket purchase (Twitter handle, occupation, age, employed / self-employed, swag preferences, photography preferences,  dietary requirements, childcare demand, etc.)
	* Does Kickstarter allow that or should do we need to use a separate tool for that?
* Besides the Kickstarter, what service(s) do we use to sell additional tickets?
* If we expect tickets to sell out quickly, we shoud consider selling in several smaller batches
* Consider time zones when opening ticket sales
* Who is on our guest list?
* We should consider having "diversity tickets"
* Should we consider having student tickets? What are the requirements?
* Same about early bird tickets ... How does that match the Kickstarter approach?

## Technical

* We need to ask for the speakers technical equipment, OSs, AV connectivity, presentation format, slide resolution and tell them about the available equipment
* Ensure that the necessary AV adapters are available (including replacements for drop-outs)
* Ensure that a fallback laptop is available with a copy of the presentations, tested with the AV equipment
* Technical setup should be finished the night before the conference if possible
* Check heating / aircon in advance (shouldn't be a problem in Iceland)
* The AV technician
	* should instruct all speakers before the conference starts
	* must know all the important key timings
* Do we provide WiFi for the attendees? Does the venue have that already?
	* Is it an open WiFi or may it be secure?
	* How do we communicate WiFi credentials?
* Do we provide an additional organizer/speaker-only WiFi?
* Can we provide power sockets for charging devices?
* Equipment
	* Projector
	* AV setup
	* Dedicated speaker screen
	* Timer / stopwatch
	* Presenter
* Ensure the stage allows safe, quiet walking
* Can we have video / audio recording?
	* Live broadcast? (Do we want that?)
* Who is going to take (professional) pictures?
	* Take care of intellectual property regulations ...

## Staff / volunteers

* Who is our staff? Do we have local support?
	* Registration
	* Tech staff
	* etc.
* Do we need / want to have volunteers?
	* How do we recruit them?
	* When do they arrive and how do we instruct them? (should be the day before the conference)
* Staff must be clearly identifyable, briefed and able to help

## Talks

* Do we make a call for papers or do we cherry-pick the talks & speakers?
	* If there's a CFP, it should be made clear that contributions from minorities and groups that are traditionally under-represented are particularly welcome
* How many talks / time slots to we have (6? 7?)
* What kind of talks to we aim for?
	* Length
	* Single speaker ↔ multiple speakers / campfire chats or a mixture of both
		* For talks with multiple speakers on stage we'd probably need a really good moderator
	* Break-out sessions?
* There must be reasonable breaks between talks
	* 15-30 minutes between talks
	* Long lunch break (90+ minutes)
* Tried and tested schedule
	* 9:00 registration
	* 10:00-10:45 Talk 1
	* 11:00-11:45 Talk 2
	* 12:00-12:45 Talk 3
	* Lunch break
	* 14:15-15:00 Talk 4
	* 15:15-16:00 Talk 5
	* 16:15-17:00 Talk 6
	* 17:15-18:00 Talk 7
	* After party
* Are we able to provide live transcriptions of the talks
* Ensure that the talk titles reflect the contents of the talks
* I would like the speakers to prepare **new** talks for the conference
	* We should manage to make it plain that there hasn't been a conference like this before, so how could a ready-made talk match?
	* Maybe this implies (increased) speaker fees
	* Talks should be prepared / finished at least some days ahead of the conference, not in the plane or on the hotel
* The order of talks should somehow match the typical concentration curve
	* More technical talks before noon
	* Less technical, "easy listening" talk right after the lunch break

## Speakers & talks

* How do we ensure speaker & talk diversity
	* Male / Female	
	* Icelandic / Other nationalities
	* Technical talk / Meta talk
* We should try the speakers to be present throughout the whole conference
	* They should be instructed about the key timings of the conference
	* It would be nice if the attendees had the chance to chat with them before and after their talk
* We must prepare well and introduce the speakers comprehensively and correctly
	* Correct pronounciation of their names
	* Introduce them as they would like to be introduced
	* Tell a bit about them — some attendees might not know the speakers at all
	* As for speakers' drink preferences during their talk (drink, temperature, plain/still or not, etc.)
* In case of recordings
	* Ensure that we have permission to record them (at best, tell them when accepting their talk proposal)
	* Instruct speakers about the area on stage the have to stick to due to camera / lightning setup; put white tape strips on the floor 
* Clearly instruct speakers in advance
	* About their time slot
	* About technical stuff
	* Questions after the talk or not? If so, take questions with a microphone only etc.
* Tell the speakers as much as possible about the background of the attendees in advance so that they can tailor their contents
* Provide the speakers a quiet room to prepare or just relax
* We need to have a scrum-like speaker dinner
* We need to have speaker welcome packages with e.g.
	* some local goods
	* fruits
	* a city map
	* etc.
* We need to collect quite some information from the speakers to book their flights & hotels (full names, birthdates, identification document numbers, expiry dates, flight & food preferences etc.); Maybe use border:none registration form as a template? Worked out well ...

## Drinks & snacks

* We need unlimited drinks (water, good! coffee, tee) on the spot
	* ideally for free (sponsored?)
	* ideally taken care of by some professional gastronomy (would be ideal if the venue was a cinema with a bar or something similar)
* We should have healthy snacks (if any), not only junk food, so that people don't fall asleep because of a sugar crash
	* We could provide fresh vegetables (carrots, apples, etc.)
* Do we provide lunch or do we encourage people to go out and grab some food in the area around?
	* If we provide lunch ... 
		* it must be healthy and for all sorts of preferences and dietary requirements (meat eaters, vegetarians, vegans, etc.)
		* We need to make sure that people really get the food they "ordered"
	* If we don't provide lunch, we should build a list of food / snack spots

## Post-processing

* Get feedback from the attendees to improve the event
	* promptly & on the spot, e.g. a paper based feedback form, but in a situation where they don't feel like being watched
	* about each talk
	* about the conference as a whole

## Design

* What's the general strategy?
	* Little effort → low costs? (see Responsive Day Out)
	* On the other hand: An event needs a strong visual identity; Material would have good prerequisites
* Who's going to design the personalized badges?
* Where are the badges produced (must be pretty just-in-time; Icelandic online printshop?)
* The badges should include a printed schedule so that people don't need their smartphone to look it up

## Swag

* People tend to dislike swag in the meantime. There's almost no useful swag.
* If we provide swag (... sponsors ...), we should let people opt out when buying the ticket




## Organizer, speaker & attendee accommodation

* Cooperations with hotels etc.?


## Sponsors

* Should get free tickets if they wish


## Exhibitors

* Exhibitors should have a practical way to scan name badges
* Need the breaks for having conversations

## Kickstarter


## Venue

* When is it available?
* What does it cost?
* Who does it run? Is it capable of running an event like that?
* Are there enough toilets?
* Is there gastronomy of any kind included?
* Does the venue provide WiFi?
* Are there any quiet zones for relaxing?
* How accessible is the venue (e.g. for wheelchair users)
* Is there a wardrobe?

## Extra services

* Is there demand for childcare in this case?
	* In general I'd say yes, but in this special case we should really check the demand. People from abroad won't bring their children. What do Icelanders do at that time of the year? Are the children in kindergarden / school or are they on holiday?
	* What are the legal prerequisites for a "temporary kindergarden" in Iceland?


## Costs

* Venue
* Speakers?
* Insurance?
* Speaker dinner

## Party

* Will there be an official after-party (even if only in a pub)? At which location?

# Misc

* Provide tampons / hygiene products at the restrooms

# Side events / workshops

* What side events / workshops can we provide?
