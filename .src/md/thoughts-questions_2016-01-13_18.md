Material 2016 January Session
=============================
> Ideas, thoughts & questions

This is a (still incomplete and very unsorted) list of things we should consider when organizing **_Material 2016_**. It's a combination of the practices and experiences with my previous events, especially learnings from the [border:none](https://border-none.net) conferences, and [many](https://gist.github.com/anselmh/819e724a8e513a61837c) [other](https://gist.github.com/doismellburning/6ef44a51df271bca4782) [people's](https://github.com/erikr/lessobviouschecklist) thoughts.

**_Material 2016_** is all about "doing the right things" on the Web. To keep aligned with that, we should always strive for making it the most excellent conference experience we can create — not only for the attendees, but also for the speakers, the venue, the team and ourselves.


Preparation & setup
===================

## General / Identity

* The conference must have a well specified name, pronounciation and writing
* The conference should have a strong visual identitiy. This may include but is not limited to
	* a logo
	* a general artwork (corporate design)
	* a website design
	* a design for print stuff like flyers, banners, badges etc.
	* a design for slides (e.g. during the breaks)
	* opening titles (video)


## Diversity / Inclusivity / Accessibility

* Our topmost goal must be to always make attendees feel welcome before, during and after the event
* We need a Code of Conduct
* We need an inclusivity & diversity policy
* We need an accessibility statement (what exactly can we offer to impaired visitors?)


## Communication

* We should introduce and establish a hashtag (before others do) 
* We should monitor that hashtag in advance (and social media coverage in general)
* We need regular reminders in the run-up to the conference
	* Monthly(?) newsletters
	* Regular social media postings about speakers, sponsors, etc.


## Website

* The website must clearly display the dates and locations of the event
	* ... got criticized for the border:none website for being "over-designed" 
* The website must be easy to use and fully accessible with a wide range of devices
* The website must provide
	* The schedule (also in a printable form)
	* A list of the speakers and their talks
	* Location, travel & public transport information
		* How to get from the airport to the hotels?
		* How to get to the venue(s)?
		* Nice spots for food & drinks around the venues (e.g. Foursquare list)?
		* Some important things about Iceland, it's people and culture in general 
		* Information about SIM cards & data plans
		* Visa information if possible / applicable
	* Hotel recommendations
	* The Code of Conduct
	* The diversity and inclusivity policy
	* The accessibility statement
* The website must display information about the ticket prices and availability
* Ideally people can buy tickets on the website 


# Promotion material / swag

* What's the general strategy?
	* Little effort → low costs? (see Responsive Day Out)
	* On the other hand: An event needs a strong visual identity; Material would have good prerequisites
* Who's going to design and produce the personalized badges (just-in-time)?
* If we provide swag at all (... sponsors ...), we should let people opt out when buying the ticket
* In this case I could imagine neat, local welcome gifts, maybe something crafty, that give a first emotion about the topic "material" 


## Tickets & prices

* What is our general price strategy?
	1. Keep ticket prices as low as possible, do without any bells and whistles? 
	2. Aim for a particular price level and see how far we can get with it?
	3. Put together the best possible (reasonably priced) experience and accept the costs for it?
* What are the things we could waive compared to other conferences (a sustainable / reasonable use of all kinds of materials and resources should be our topmost goal anyway ...)?
* How can we sufficiently communicate where the attendees' money is going to?
* Ask for details during ticket purchase (does Kickstarter allow that or do we need to use a separate tool for that?):
	* Twitter handle (to print it on the badge)
	* Occupation (statistics)
	* Age (statistics)
	* Employed / self-employed (statistics)
	* Swag preferences (opt-in)
	* Privacy / photography preferences (→ Lanyards)
	* Dietary requirements
	* Childcare demand
* What service(s) do we use to sell additional tickets after the Kickstarter phase?
* If we expect tickets to sell out quickly, we shoud consider selling in several smaller batches (does Kickstarter allow this)
* We should consider time zones when opening ticket sales
* Who is on our guest list?
* We should consider having "diversity tickets" / "scholarships" (enable people to attend the conference who couldn't normally afford)
* Should we consider having student tickets? What are the requirements?


## Technical

* We must ask for the speakers' technical equipment, OSs, AV connectivity, presentation format, slide resolution and tell them about the available equipment


## Staff / volunteers

* Who is our staff?
	* Registration desk
	* Tech staff
	* Helping hands
	* etc.
* Do we need / want to have volunteers?
	* How do we recruit them?
	* When do they arrive and how do we instruct them? (should be the day before the conference)
* Which locals can help us?


## Speakers

* How do we ensure speaker & talk diversity?
	* Male / Female	
	* Icelandic / From abroad
	* Technical talk / Meta talk
* In case of recordings: Make sure that we have permission to record them (at best, tell them when accepting their talk proposal)
* Tell the speakers as much as possible about the background of the attendees in advance so that they can tailor their contents
* We need to collect quite some information from the speakers to book their flights & hotels (full names, birthdates, identification document numbers, expiry dates, flight & food preferences etc.); Maybe use border:none registration form as a template? Worked well ...


## Talks / schedule

* Do we make a call for proposals or do we cherry-pick the talks & speakers (or a mixture of both)?
	* If there's a CFP, it should be made clear that contributions from minorities and groups that are traditionally under-represented are particularly welcome
* How many talks / time slots to we have (6? 7?)
* What kind of talks to we aim for?
	1. Length
	2. Single speaker ↔ multiple speakers / campfire chats or a mixture of both (for talks with multiple speakers on stage we'd probably need a really good moderator)
	3. Break-out sessions?
* Ensure that the talk titles reflect the contents of the talks
* I would like the speakers to prepare **new** talks for the conference
	* We should manage to make it plain that there hasn't been a conference like this before, so how could a ready-made talk match?
	* Maybe this implies (increased) speaker fees
	* Talks should be prepared / finished at least some days ahead of the conference, not in the plane or on the hotel
* The order of talks should somehow match the typical concentration curve
	* More technical talks before noon
	* Less technical, "easy listening" talk right after the lunch break


## Organizer, speaker & attendee accommodation

* Cooperations with hotels etc.?


## Sponsors

* Should get free tickets if they wish


## Kickstarter

* What do we need for the Kickstarter?
* When will we launch it?


## Venue

* When is it available?
* What does it cost?
* Who does it run? Is it capable of running an event like that?
* Are there enough toilets?
* Is there gastronomy of any kind?
* Does the venue provide WiFi?
* Are there any quiet zones for relaxing?
* How accessible is the venue (e.g. for wheelchair users)
* Is there a wardrobe?
* The Code of Conduct and the diversity & inclusivity policy must be displayed clearly


## Extra services

* Is there demand for childcare in this case?
	* In general I'd say yes, but in this special case we should really check the demand. People from abroad won't bring their children. What do Icelanders do at that time of the year? Are the children in kindergarden / school or are they on holiday at that time?
* What are the legal prerequisites for a "temporary kindergarden" in Iceland?


## Costs / calculation

* Venue
* Speakers?
* Insurance?
* Speaker dinner


Right before the event / registration
=====================================

## Privacy

* Attendees might prefer not to be photographed during the conference
	* We could have two differently colored lanyards to reflect the attendees' preferences


## Technical

* Technical setup should be finished the night before the conference (if possible)
* Check heating / aircon in advance (shouldn't be a problem in Iceland)
* The AV technician
	* should instruct all speakers before the conference starts
	* must know all the important key timings


## Staff / volunteers

* Staff must be clearly identifyable, briefed and always able to help


## Speakers

* We should try to make the speakers be present throughout the whole conference
	* They must be instructed about the key timings of the conference
	* It would be nice if the attendees had the chance to chat with them after their talk
* As for speakers' drink preferences (kind of drink, temperature, plain/still or not, etc.
* Instruct speakers about the area on stage the have to stick to due to camera / lightning setup; put white tape strips on the floor 
* Clearly instruct speakers in advance
	* About their time slot
	* About technical stuff
	* Questions after the talk or not? If so, take questions with a microphone only etc.
* We must organize a speaker dinner the evening before the conference to give them the change to meet each other and get a good feeling
* We need to have some nice speaker welcome packages with e.g.
	* some local specialties,
	* fruits,
	* a city map,
	* etc.


During the event
================

## Communication

* We should prepare a twitter wall to enable engagement between the visitors
	* Where can it be displayed during the event?
* Can we provide a backchannel during the talks to discuss them "live"?
	* Maybe this is counter-productive (people staring at their smartphones during the talks ...)?


## Diversity / Inclusivity / Accessibility

* We could consider having a [real-time captioner](http://composition.al/blog/2014/05/31/your-next-conference-should-have-real-time-captioning/) and / or [live translation to sign language](https://twitter.com/jkphl/status/611832718872215552)


## Technical

* Ensure that the necessary AV adapters are available (including replacements for drop-outs)
* Ensure that a fallback laptop is available with a copy of the speakers' presentations, tested with the AV equipment
* Can we provide WiFi for the attendees?
	* Does the venue have that already?
	* The WiFi should be secured. How do we communicate WiFi credentials?
* Can we provide an additional organizer / speaker-only WiFi?
* Can we provide power sockets for charging devices?
* We need the following technical equipment:
	* Projector
	* AV setup
	* Dedicated speaker screen
	* Timer / stopwatch
	* Presenter / Klicker
* Ensure the stage allows safe, quiet walking


## Schedule / talks

* There must be reasonable breaks between talks
	* 15-30 minutes between talks
	* Long lunch break (90+ minutes)
* Tried and tested schedule
	* 9:00 registration
	* 10:00-10:45 Talk 1
	* 11:00-11:45 Talk 2
	* 12:00-12:45 Talk 3
	* Lunch break
	* 14:15-15:00 Talk 4
	* 15:15-16:00 Talk 5
	* 16:15-17:00 Talk 6
	* 17:15-18:00 Talk 7
	* After party
* The badges should include a printed schedule so that people don't need their smartphone to look it up


## Speakers

* We must prepare well and introduce the speakers comprehensively and correctly
	* Correct pronounciation of their names
	* Introduce them as they would like to be introduced
	* Tell a bit about them — some attendees might not know the speakers at all
* Provide the speakers a quiet room to prepare or just relax


## Drinks & snacks

* We need unlimited drinks (water, good! coffee, tee)
	* Ideally for free for the attendees (sponsored?)
	* Ideally taken care of by some professional gastronomy (would be perfect if the venue was a cinema with a bar or something similar)
* We must have healthy snacks (if any), not only junk food, so that people don't fall asleep because of a sugar crash
	* Provide fresh vegetables (carrots, apples, etc.)
* Do we provide lunch or do we encourage people to go out and grab some food in the area around?
	* If we provide lunch ... 
		* it must be healthy and for all sorts of preferences and dietary requirements (vegetarians, vegans, etc.)
		* We need to make sure that people really get the food they "ordered" while buying their ticket
	* If we don't provide lunch, we should provide a list of food / snack spots (Foursquare list etc.)


# Restrooms

* Provide tampons / hygiene products at the restrooms
* Ensure a proper service in the restrooms (soap, toilet paper, etc.)


## Session chair

* The Code of Conduct and the diversity & inclusivity policy must be announced explicitely
* Don't forget to say thank you to everyone involved at the end of the conference:
	* The attendees
	* The speakers
	* The team
	* The sponsors
	* The venue and its staff
	* Our families
	* and so on


## Documentation

* Can we have video / audio recording?
	* Live broadcast? (Do we want that?)
* Who is going to take (professional) pictures?
	* Take care of intellectual property regulations ...
* Take and publish a picture of all the staff members before / during the event


## Exhibitors

* Exhibitors should have a practical way to scan name badges
* Need the breaks for having conversations


After the conference
====================

## Feedback

* We need to get feedback from the attendees to improve the talks & event, promptly and on the spot, e.g. a paper based feedback form, but in a situation where they don't feel watched
	* about each talk
	* about the conference as a whole

## Party

* Will there be an official after-party (even if only in a pub)? Where?


Side events / workshops
=======================

* What side events / workshops can we provide?
