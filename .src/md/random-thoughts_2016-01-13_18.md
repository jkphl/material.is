January Session — Random Thoughts
=================================

## Website

* Clearly display the dates and locations of the event
* 

## Tickets & prices

* What is our general price strategy?
	1. Keep ticket prices as low as possible, do without any bells and whistles? 
	2. Aim for a particular price level and see how far we can get with it?
	3. Compose the best possible (reasonably priced) experience and accept the costs for it?
* What are the things we could waive (useless stuff, swag)?
	* Sustainable / reasonable use of all kinds of materials and resources should be our topmost goal anyway
* How can we sufficiently communicate where the attendees' money is going into?
* Ask for some details during ticket purchase (Twitter handle, occupation, age, employed / self-employed, swag preferences, photography preferences, etc.)
	* Does Kickstarter allow that or should do we need to use a separate tool for that?
* Besides the Kickstarter, what service(s) do we use to sell additional tickets?
* Who is on our guest list?

## Technical

* We need to ask for the speakers technical equipment, OSs, AV connectivity, presentation format, slide resolution and tell them about the available equipment
* Ensure that the necessary AV adapters are available (including replacements for drop-outs)
* Ensure that a fallback laptop is available with a copy of the presentations, tested with the AV equipment
* Technical setup should be finished the night before the conference if possible
* Check heating / aircon in advance (shouldn't be a problem in Iceland)
* The AV technician
	* should instruct all speakers before the conference starts
	* must know all the important key timings
* Do we provide WiFi for the attendees? Does the venue have that already?
	* How do we communicate WiFi credentials?
* Do we provide an additional organizer/speaker-only WiFi?
* Can we provide power sockets for charging devices?
* Equipment
	* Projector
	* AV setup
	* Dedicated speaker screen
	* Timer / stopwatch
	* Presenter
* Ensure the stage allows safe, quiet walking
* Can we have video / audio recording?
	* Even live broadcast? (Do we want that?)

## Volunteers

* Do we need / want to have volunteers?
	* How do we recruit them?
	* When do they arrive and how do we instruct them? (should be the day before the conference)

## Talks

* Do we make a call for papers or do we cherry-pick the talks & speakers?
* How many talks / time slots to we have (6? 7?)
* What kind of talks to we aim for?
	* Length
	* Single speaker ↔ multiple speakers / campfire chats or a mixture of both
		* For talks with multiple speakers on stage we'd probably need a really good moderator
	* Break-out sessions?
* There must be reasonable breaks between talks
	* 15-30 minutes between talks
	* Long lunch break (90+ minutes)
* Tried and tested schedule
	* 9:00 registration
	* 10:00-10:45 Talk 1
	* 11:00-11:45 Talk 2
	* 12:00-12:45 Talk 3
	* Lunch break
	* 14:15-15:00 Talk 4
	* 15:15-16:00 Talk 5
	* 16:15-17:00 Talk 6
	* 17:15-18:00 Talk 7
	* After party
* Are we able to provide live transcriptions of the talks
* Ensure that the talk titles reflect the contents of the talks
* I would like the speakers to prepare **new** talks for the conference
	* We should manage to make it plain that there hasn't been a conference like this before, so how could a ready-made talk match?
	* Maybe this implies (increased) speaker fees
	* Talks should be prepared / finished at least some days ahead of the conference, not in the plane or on the hotel
* The order of talks should somehow match the typical concentration curve
	* More technical talks before noon
	* Less technical, "easy listening" talk right after the lunch break

## Speakers & talks

* How do we ensure speaker & talk diversity
	* Male / Female	
	* Icelandic / Other nationalities
	* Technical talk / Meta talk
* We should try the speakers to be present throughout the whole conference
	* They should be instructed about the key timings of the conference
	* It would be nice if the attendees had the chance to chat with them before and after their talk
* We must prepare well and introduce the speakers comprehensively and correctly
	* Correct pronounciation of their names
	* Introduce them as they would like to be introduced
	* Tell a bit about them — some attendees might not know the speakers at all
	* As for speakers' drink preferences during their talk (drink, temperature, plain/still or not, etc.)
* In case of recordings: Instruct speakers about the area on stage the have to stick to due to camera / lightning setup; put white tape strips on the floor 
* Clearly instruct speakers in advance
	* About their time slot
	* About technical stuff
	* Questions after the talk or not? If so, take questions with a microphone only etc.
* Tell the speakers as much as possible about the background of the attendees in advance so that they can tailor their contents
* Provide the speakers a quiet room to prepare or just relax
* We need to have a speaker dinner to ensure a good atmosphere

## Drinks & snacks

* We need unlimited drinks (water, coffee, tee) on the spot
	* ideally for free (e.g. if sponsored)
	* ideally taken care of by some professional gastronomy (would be ideal if the venue was a cinema with a bar or something similar)

## Post-processing

* Get feedback from the attendees to improve the event
	* promptly & on the spot, e.g. a paper based feedback form, but in a situation where they don't feel like being watched
	* about each talk
	* about the conference as a whole

## Design

* What's the general strategy?
	* Little effort → low costs? (see Responsive Day Out)
	* On the other hand: An event needs a strong visual identity; Material would have good prerequisites
* Who's going to design the personalized badges?
* Where are the badges produced (must be pretty just-in-time; Icelandic online printshop?)
* The badges should include a printed schedule so that people don't need their smartphone to look it up

## Merchandise / swag bags


## Documentation / communication

* We need a code of conduct (on the website & on the spot) that should be explicitely announced
* We should introduce and establish a hashtag before others do (#material16)
* We should monitor that hashtag way in advance
* We should monitor social media coverage in general
* Will there be a twitter wall or similar running throughout the conference? Where is it shown?
* Can we provide a backchannel during the talks to discuss them "live"? Or ist this counter-productive (people staring onto their smartphones ...)?
* Regular reminders in the run-up to the conference
	* Monthly(?) newsletter
	* Regular social media postings about speakers, sponsors, etc.
* We should provide location, travel & public transport information
	* How to get from the airport to the partnering hotels
	* How to get to the venue(s)
	* Nice spots for food & drinks around the venues (e.g. Foursquare list)
	* Some important things about Iceland, it's people and culture in general 
* Attendees might prefer not to be photographed during the conference
	* A smart solution to communicate this could be two differently colored lanyards to clearly signalize the attendees' preferences

## Organizer, speaker & attendee accommodation

* Cooperations with hotels etc.?


## Sponsors


## Kickstarter


## Venue

* When is it available?
* What does it cost?
* Who does it run? Is it capable of running an event like that?
* Are there enough toilets?
* Is there gastronomy of any kind included?
* Does the venue provide WiFi?
* Are there any quiet zones for relaxing?
* How accessible is the venue (e.g. for wheelchair users)

## Extra services

* Is there demand for childcare in this case?
	* In general I'd say yes, but in this special case we should really check the demand. People from abroad won't bring their children. What do Icelanders do at that time of the year? Are the children in kindergarden / school or are they on holiday?
	* What are the legal prerequisites for a "temporary kindergarden" in Iceland?


## Costs

* Venue
* Speakers?
* Insurance?
* Speaker dinner
