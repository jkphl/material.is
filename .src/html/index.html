                    <p>20+ years of the Web and we are still at the very beginning of <em>understanding and implementing digitization</em>.</p>
                    <p>For the first time we are facing a generation that never got to know <em>the offline world</em>. By nature they are riding the wave without ever having touched the ground.</p>
                    <p>We might have unlearned our ancestors' knowledge about materials and crafts, it's easy to overlook the <em>intrinsic characteristics of the Web</em> in favour of the newest framework or boilerplate.</p>
                    <p class="tagline">Let's re-explore the material Web and evaluate what we have learned so far. Join us in Reykjavik, Iceland for a trip through history, views and cultures.</p>
                    <p>For centuries we've worked with wood, metal, glass, ceramic, paper, textiles. More recently, new materials have emerged; plastics, fiberglass, silicon, and more. We understand their limitations, their affordances. We can fold, heat, manipulate and warp some of these materials. But the Internet and the Web are still very new to us. We don't fully understand them as a material.</p>
                    <p class="em">What does this mean for the Web? What are the properties of the Web as a Material?</p>
                    <p>We have lost the Apprentice/Master relationship in the digital world. Spending years getting our hands dirty with an expert, learning slowly and really understanding the material rather than the framework. We need to be asking ourselves what sacrifices should we be making for the convenience of our customers rather than shortcuts for ourselves.</p>
                    <p class="em">What properties of materialness exists in the Web is what this conference is meant to explore.</p>

                    <p><strong><a href="http://www.solidwool.com" target="_blank">Hannah and Justin Floyd</a></strong> had an idea. What if they could find a new way of working with wool and so perhaps bring something back to their small market town, a once thriving part of the woollen industry?</p>
                    <p>They learnt that the coarse wool from hill-farmed, upland sheep had dramatically lost its value in recent years. So they started to play. To turn the way wool is worked on its head. The end result is <a href="http://www.solidwool.com" target="_blank">Solidwool</a> — a strong, beautiful and unique composite material. Think fibreglass, but with wool.</p>
                    <p>They know better than anyone else, literally down to the micron scale about wool. That deep understanding is what we're going to talk about in relation to knowing your material and its affordances.</p>

                    <p><strong><a href="http://amberwilson.co.uk" target="_blank">Amber Wilson</a></strong> Amber Wilson worked in the field of Psychology for many years and is now a budding Web developer at a design agency in Brighton. New to Web development, she is continually eager to improve her skills.</p>

                    <p>She has found that the skills and experiences she picked up studying and working within Psychology have guided her as a developer - sometimes in surprising ways, always in useful ways, and in some ways she has yet to discover.</p>

                    <p>She is excited to bring along her unique perspective on Web development through the eyes of a discipline she knows so well. She'll talk to us about how folk that work on the Web can be aware of other disciplines that surround us, embrace their lessons, and harness these to build both a stronger Web and stronger bonds with each other. </p>

                    <p>He teaches mostly theory courses and will be discussing the history of technology and design with examples of perspective tesselations and other patterns. He's been working in design since before the first Macintosh computers and has grown and learned with the technology. Now he has a few choice words to say about artificial intelligence, virtual reality and superficial design using computers — this should be interesting discussion to say the least.</p>

                    <p>He'll be exploring more about stories, their form, structure, beginnings, middles, endings, people, places, things, setbacks, climaxes and conflict. The Web also has form and structure, pages, links, javascript, audio, video,  text, control, personalisation and adaptation.</p>
                    <p>When we take stories onto the Web we can do things that haven't been possible before. Giving you control over how much detail you get in the news, adapt a podcast to fit your commuting time, present fiction in different forms and across different media.</p>
                    <p>Through a series of examples from the BBC and elsewhere he'll look at some experiments with storytelling on the Web and explore some of the future directions we could take.</p>

                    <p>Tommy is going to enlighten us about some of the challenges that Polaroid and other companies are facing. He's going to look at Polaroid's history and the intersection of art and science, the importance of tangibility and will explore the resurgence of physicality and nostalgia. Why are we all so interested in vinyl records to film photography?</p>
                    <p>We now have the power to capture and explore how memories move, how does that impact the way we think about or digital lives?</p>

                    <p>In this short talk, they'll surprise you with what you thought their ingredients were as well as their ingenious use of waste-materials repackages as a new product.</p>

                    <p><strong><a href="http://halldor.eldjarn.is" target="_blank">Halldór Eldjárn</a></strong> is a musician &amp; audio developer who will tell us a little story about how he took 15,000 public domain photos from NASA's Apollo Space Mission and created a unique soundscape for every single one. Hint: They were programatically generated!</p>

                    <p>Halldór created the piece to open up this incredible photo library. The mood in the pictures is somewhat unusual as some of them quite casual unlike the most famous and polished pictures we are so used to seeing, from these missions. Some are even quite bad, but still they are taken during one of the most incredible journeys mankind has embarked upon and thus become mysterious and exciting. The web app selects pictures at random and the browser then starts playing the soundtrack for that picture.</p>

                    <p>When dealing with the Web, we tend to think solely about the screen and visual experience, but in this mini-talk we'll explore the material of sound and what that means.</p>

                <p>The conference will be held on August 17th at Norræna húsið, the <strong><a href="http://nordichouse.is/en/" target="_blank">Nordic House</a></strong>. Built in 1968 by acclaimed Finnish modernist architect Alvar Aalto, located in the center of Reykjavík, it is a short walking distance from various hotels and guesthouses.</p>
                <p>The house maintains a library and focuses on Nordic Region information services. In addition, there is a shop for Nordic design and food products, exhibition space and auditoriums. The house also features an acclaimed restaurant serving New Nordic food — this is where we plan to have lunch together.</p>
                <p>Rather than using a full-service hotel or conference center, we are trying a smaller, cozier and definitely more memorable location.</p>

                <h2>Travel and accomodation</h2>
                <p>We started putting together a <a href="https://foursquare.com/jkphl/list/material-2016" target="_blank">Foursquare list</a> with lots of recommendations in downtown Reykjavík, including lodging opportunities. There are also plenty of nice <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Reykjavík" target="_blank">AirBnbs</a> around town, so please check them out as well.</p>
                <p>We know that travelling to Iceland for a conference might sound like an adventure — and it is! — if you need any help or suggestions, just let us know while we'll keep reaching out to hotels and potential sponsors to get some good deals for you.</p>
