        <p>The Internet and the Web are still very new to us. We don't fully understand them as a material. For
            centuries
            we've worked with wood, metal, glass, ceramic, paper, textiles. More recently, new materials have emerged;
            plastics,
            fiberglass, silicon, and more. We understand their limitations, their affordances. We can fold, heat,
            manipulate
            and warp some of these materials.</p>
        <p class="em">What does this mean for the Web? What are the properties of the Web as a Material?</p>
        <p>We have lost the Apprentice/Master relationship in the digital world. Spending years getting our hands dirty
            with
            an expert, learning slowly and really understanding the material rather than the framework. We need to be
            asking
            ourselves what sacrifices should we be making for the convinience of our customers rather than shortcuts for
            ourselves.</p>
        <p class="em">That is what this conference is meant to explore.</p>

        <h3>Speakers & Venue</h3>
        <p>Nothing has been sorted out yet. We are exploring venues and speakers in the next few weeks. We'd like to
            bring a mix of people internationally and Icelandic locals. The venues on our short-list are
            all in central Reykjavík, easy to access from various hotels and guesthouses. More importantly, near plenty
            of
            great food and shops.</p>

        <h3>Workshops</h3>
        <p>As something extra, we want to try and organize some small workshops around different materials. For example,
            a
            Ceramic studio workshop, Leather craft, Letterpress, etc. These are <abbr
                    title="To Be Determined">TBD</abbr>
            both when, where and what.</p>

        <h3>Tickets</h3>
        <p>Once we have settled on a venue and the first bits of a schedule, we'll have a kickstarter campaign to sell
            tickets.
            We know that travelling to Iceland for a conference might sound like an adventure — and it is! — so please
            bear with us
            while we put together the best experience possible.</p>
