                    <p>20+ years of the Web and we are still at the very beginning of <em>understanding and implementing digitization</em>.</p>
                    <p>For the first time we are facing a generation that never got to know <em>the offline world</em>. By nature they are riding the wave without ever having touched the ground.</p>
                    <p>We might have unlearned our ancestors' knowledge about materials and crafts, it's easy to overlook the <em>intrinsic characteristics of the Web</em> in favour of the newest framework or boilerplate.</p>
                    <p class="tagline">Let's re-explore the material Web and evaluate what we have learned so far. Join us in Reykjavik, Iceland for a trip through history, views and cultures.</p>
                    <p>For centuries we've worked with wood, metal, glass, ceramic, paper, textiles. More recently, new materials have emerged; plastics, fiberglass, silicon, and more. We understand their limitations, their affordances. We can fold, heat, manipulate and warp some of these materials. But the Internet and the Web are still very new to us. We don't fully understand them as a material.</p>
                    <p class="em">What does this mean for the Web? What are the properties of the Web as a Material?</p>
                    <p>We have lost the Apprentice/Master relationship in the digital world. Spending years getting our hands dirty with an expert, learning slowly and really understanding the material rather than the framework. We need to be asking ourselves what sacrifices should we be making for the convinience of our customers rather than shortcuts for ourselves.</p>
                    <p class="em">What properties of materialness exists in the Web is what this conference is meant to explore.</p>

                <h2>Speakers</h2>

                <p class="clear">We'll bring a mix of <strong>5-6 people</strong> internationally and Icelandic locals. A few invitations have gone out and we are slowly collecting who's available when, so stay tuned for updates!</p>

                <p>Our first confirmed speaker is <strong><a href="http://amberwilson.co.uk" target="_blank">Amber Wilson</a></strong>. Amber is a budding designer continually getting excited about everything to do with the Web whether it's front-end development, server side languages or user experience. Last July she discovered the Web development community in sunny Brighton, UK, and began to build her skills while enjoying getting to know people. She's had an appreciation and love of both design and science from a really young age and is always seeking to learn more about both. Also fascinated by people, she pursued a Master's degree in Child Psychology and with this can bring a unique perspective on respecting both where we've come from and where we'll go in terms of the Web.</p>

                <h2>The Nordic House</h2>
                <p>For our first pilot conference on August 17th, we decided to use Norræna húsið, the <strong><a href="http://nordichouse.is/en/" target="_blank">Nordic House</a></strong>. Built in 1968 by acclaimed Finnish modernist architect Alvar Aalto, located close to the center of Reykjavík, it is easy to access from various hotels and guesthouses within short walking distance.</p>
                <p>The house maintains a library and the Nordic Region in Focus information service. In addition, there is a shop for Nordic design and food products, exhibition space and auditoriums. The house also features an acclaimed restaurant serving New Nordic food — this is where we will have lunch together.</p>
                <p>Rather than use a full-service hotel or conference center, we are trying a smaller, cozier and definitely more memorable location.</p>

                <h2>Travel and accomodation</h2>
                <p>We started putting together a <a href="https://foursquare.com/jkphl/list/material-2016" target="_blank">Foursquare list</a> with lots of recommendations in downtown Reykjavík, including lodging opportunities. There are also plenty of nice <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Reykjavík" target="_blank">AirBnbs</a> around town, so please check them out as well.</p>
                <p>We know that travelling to Iceland for a conference might sound like an adventure — and it is! — if you need any help or suggestions, just let us know.</p>
