                <div class="p-description" itemprop="description">
                    <p>20+ years of the Web and we are still at the very beginning of <em>understanding and implementing digitization</em>.</p>
                    <p>For the first time we are facing a generation that never got to know <em>the offline world</em>. By nature they are riding the wave without ever having touched the ground.</p>
                    <p>Like we might have unlearned our ancestors' knowledge about materials and crafts, it's easy to overlook the <em>intrinsic characteristics of the Web</em> in favour of the newest framework or boilerplate.</p>
                    <p class="tagline">Let's re-explore the material Web and evaluate what we have learned so far. Join us to Iceland for a trip through history, views and cultures. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/material16/material-conference-2016" target="_blank">Back us on Kickstarter</a> and let this become real.</p>
                    <p>The Internet and the Web are still very new to us. We don't fully understand them as a material. For
                        centuries
                        we've worked with wood, metal, glass, ceramic, paper, textiles. More recently, new materials have emerged;
                        plastics,
                        fiberglass, silicon, and more. We understand their limitations, their affordances. We can fold, heat,
                        manipulate
                        and warp some of these materials.</p>
                    <p class="em">What does this mean for the Web? What are the properties of the Web as a Material?</p>
                    <p>We have lost the Apprentice/Master relationship in the digital world. Spending years getting our hands dirty
                        with
                        an expert, learning slowly and really understanding the material rather than the framework. We need to be
                        asking
                        ourselves what sacrifices should we be making for the convinience of our customers rather than shortcuts for
                        ourselves.</p>
                    <p class="em">What properties of materialness exists in the Web is what this conference is meant to explore.</p>

                <h3>Speakers</h3>
                <p>Our first confirmed speaker is <a href="http://www.petrosalema.com" target="_blank">Petro Salema</a>. He is a designer and programmer whose driving mission is to use technology and design to build tools that enable people to do great things in new and inspiring ways. Most recently, he has been doing that by leading the development of the Aloha Editor project. Based in Vienna, Austria, originally from Tanzania, he will be enlightening us on all things in his life dealing with the Web as a Material. We're excited to hear what he comes up with!</p>
                <p>Our second confirmed speaker is <a href="http://moleitau.com" target="_blank">Matt Jones</a>. Former BERG Principle, now working at Google NYC on various top secret things. He'll be giving us a short presentation and then curating a slot looking at some of the ideas around raw computing. If the Web were a material, he'd brute force his way to the best answer, maybe without even understanding how he got there — and that's OK.</p>

                <p>Other speakers haven't been sorted out yet. We'd like to bring a mix of people internationally and Icelandic locals. A few invitations have gone out and we are slowly collecting who's available when. </p>

                <h3>Venue: Iðnó</h3>
                <p>For July 22nd, we decided to use Iðnó, short for Iðnaðarmannahúsið. Built in 1896, located in the center of Reykjavík, it is easy to access from various hotels and guesthouses. More importantly, near plenty of great food and shops.</p>
                <p>Rather than use a full-service hotel or conference center, we are trying a smaller, cozier and definitely more memorable location.</p>

                <h3>Field Trip</h3>
                <p>As something extra, we want to try and organize a small field trip around town meeting with companies who deal with different materials. For example, a Ceramic studio workshop, Leather craft, Letterpress, Aluminium casting, etc. These are <abbr title="To Be Determined">TBD</abbr> both when, where and what.</p>

                <h3>Tickets</h3>
                <p>As of March 9th, tickets are <em><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/material16/material-conference-2016" target="_blank">available via a Kickstarter campaign</a></em> that is running for 30 days. The regular tickets cost $150 and are limited to 145. There are also rewards for people who can't attend in person and still want to be part of our little adventure.</p>
                <p>This is the phase that will decide whether Material 2016 can become reality, so <strong>we really need your support</strong> now. Please back us with any amount you can, every little bit helps. Also, we'd be very happy if you could help us spreading the word!</p>

                <h3>Travel and accomodation</h3>
                <p>It's a little bit too early to think about travel stuff until the Kickstarter succeeds, but we started putting together a <a href="https://foursquare.com/jkphl/list/material-2016" target="_blank">Foursquare list</a> with lots of recommendations in downtown Reykjavík, including lodging opportunities. There are also plenty of nice <a href="https://www.airbnb.de/s/Reykjavík" target="_blank">AirBnbs</a> around town, so please check them out as well. We plan to open up some sort of communication platform soon where you can discuss travel and accommodation sharing possibilities with other attendees. Stay tuned!</p>
                <p>We know that travelling to Iceland for a conference might sound like an adventure — and it is! — so please bear with us while we try to get some special deals for you.</p>
