                    <p>The Internet and the Web are still very new to us. We don't fully understand them as a material. For
                        centuries
                        we've worked with wood, metal, glass, ceramic, paper, textiles. More recently, new materials have emerged;
                        plastics,
                        fiberglass, silicon, and more. We understand their limitations, their affordances. We can fold, heat,
                        manipulate
                        and warp some of these materials.</p>
                    <p class="em">What does this mean for the Web? What are the properties of the Web as a Material?</p>
                    <p>We have lost the Apprentice/Master relationship in the digital world. Spending years getting our hands dirty
                        with
                        an expert, learning slowly and really understanding the material rather than the framework. We need to be
                        asking
                        ourselves what sacrifices should we be making for the convinience of our customers rather than shortcuts for
                        ourselves.</p>
                    <p class="em">What properties of materialness exists in the Web is what this conference is meant to explore.</p>

                <h3>Speakers</h3>
                <div class="speaker-list">
                    <img src="img/fish-leather-holder.png" alt="Petro Salema" />
                    <img src="img/fish-leather-holder.png" alt="Unknown Speaker" />

                </div>
                <p>Nothing has been sorted out yet. We'd like to
                    bring a mix of people internationally and Icelandic locals. A few invitations have gone out and we are slowly collecting who's available when. </p>

                <h3>Venue: Iðnó</h3>
                <p>We decided to use Iðnó, short for Iðnaðarmannahúsið. Built in 1896, located in the center of Reykjavík, it has easy to access from various hotels and guesthouses. More importantly, near plenty of great food and shops.</p>
                <p>Rather than use a full-service hotel or confence center, we are trying a smaller, cozier and definately more memeroable location.</p>

                <h3>Field Trip</h3>
                <p>As something extra, we want to try and organize a small field trip around town meeting with companies who deal with different materials. For example,
                    a
                    Ceramic studio workshop, Leather craft, Letterpress, Aluminium casting, etc. These are <abbr
                            title="To Be Determined">TBD</abbr>
                    both when, where and what.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Tickets</h3>
                <p>Once we have settled on a venue and the first bits of a schedule, we'll have a kickstarter campaign to sell
                    tickets.
                    We know that travelling to Iceland for a conference might sound like an adventure — and it is! — so please
                    bear with us
                    while we put together the best experience possible.</p>
