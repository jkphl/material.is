                    <p>20+ years of the Web and we are still at the very beginning of <em>understanding and implementing digitization</em>.</p>
                    <p>For the first time we are facing a generation that never got to know <em>the offline world</em>. By nature they are riding the wave without ever having touched the ground.</p>
                    <p>We might unlearned our ancestors' knowledge about materials and crafts, it's easy to overlook the <em>intrinsic characteristics of the Web</em> in favour of the newest framework or boilerplate.</p>
                    <p class="tagline">Let's re-explore the material Web and evaluate what we have learned so far. Join us in Reykjavik, Iceland for a trip through history, views and cultures.</p>
                    <p>For centuries we've worked with wood, metal, glass, ceramic, paper, textiles. More recently, new materials have emerged; plastics, fiberglass, silicon, and more. We understand their limitations, their affordances. We can fold, heat, manipulate and warp some of these materials. But the Internet and the Web are still very new to us. We don't fully understand them as a material.</p>
                    <p class="em">What does this mean for the Web? What are the properties of the Web as a Material?</p>
                    <p>We have lost the Apprentice/Master relationship in the digital world. Spending years getting our hands dirty with an expert, learning slowly and really understanding the material rather than the framework. We need to be asking ourselves what sacrifices should we be making for the convinience of our customers rather than shortcuts for ourselves.</p>
                    <p class="em">What properties of materialness exists in the Web is what this conference is meant to explore.</p>

                <p>Our first confirmed speaker is <strong><a href="http://www.petrosalema.com" target="_blank">Petro Salema</a></strong>. He is a designer and programmer whose driving mission is to use technology and design to build tools that enable people to do great things in new and inspiring ways. Most recently, he has been doing that by leading the development of the Aloha Editor project. Based in Vienna, Austria, originally from Tanzania, he will be enlightening us on all things in his life dealing with the Web as a Material. We're excited to hear what he comes up with!</p>



                <p class="clear">We'll bring a mix of <strong>6-7 people</strong> internationally and Icelandic locals. A few invitations have gone out and we are slowly collecting who's available when, so stay tuned for updates!</p>

                <h3>Venue: Iðnó</h3>
                <p>For July 22nd, we decided to use Iðnó, short for Iðnaðarmannahúsið. Built in 1896, located in the center of Reykjavík, it is easy to access from various hotels and guesthouses. More importantly, near plenty of great food and shops.</p>
                <p>Rather than use a full-service hotel or conference center, we are trying a smaller, cozier and definitely more memorable location.</p>

                <p>We started putting together a <a href="https://foursquare.com/jkphl/list/material-2016" target="_blank">Foursquare list</a> with lots of recommendations in downtown Reykjavík, including lodging opportunities. There are also plenty of nice <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Reykjavík" target="_blank">AirBnbs</a> around town, so please check them out as well.</p>
                <p>We know that travelling to Iceland for a conference might sound like an adventure — and it is! — if you need any help or suggestions, just let us know.</p>
