                <h2>The Web as a material</h2>
                <p>For centuries we've worked with wood, metal, glass, ceramic, paper, textiles. More recently, new
                    materials have emerged; plastics, fiberglass, silicon, and more. We understand their limitations,
                    their affordances. We can fold, heat, manipulate and warp some of these materials. But the Internet
                    and the Web are still very new to us. We don't fully understand them as a material.</p>
                <p class="em">What does this mean for the Web? What are the properties of the Web as a Material?</p>
                <p>We have lost the apprentice / master relationship in the digital world. Spending years getting our
                    hands dirty with an expert, learning slowly and really understanding the material rather than the
                    framework. We need to be asking ourselves what sacrifices should we be making for the convenience of
                    our customers rather than shortcuts for ourselves.</p>
                <p class="em">What properties of materialness exists in the Web is what this conference is meant to
                    explore.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://stephanierieger.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Stephanie</a> is a designer, researcher, and product strategist with an expertise in the sociocultural, economic, and systemic impacts of technology. A mobile industry veteran, Stephanie has worked with some of the world's leading technology brands including Microsoft, Philips, Intel, Symbian, Nokia, Opera Software, and Mozilla. She is also co-founder and principal at <a href="https://yiibu.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">yiibu</a>, a small design studio that blends product strategy, research, and foresight to explore issues around automation, algorithms, and the future of the (open?) internet.</p>

                    <h4>Regulating the web</h4>
                    <p>At a time when Facebook’s products provide a rich (but closed) alternative to the web for close to 3 billion people, and 50% of Google searches no longer result in a click to the ‘open web’, we are confronted with a rather urgent question: what shape will the web take in a world beset with the challenges that are now upon us? From climate chaos and disinformation, to the rapid and sustained socio-cultural shifts that come with dramatic changes to how we live; if the web is a material, what will it be good for? If it’s a tool, who will it serve? </p>
 
                    <p>In this talk I will explore the twenty-six words that helped create the open and experimental internet we hold dear; how that openness is threatened by a new wave of regulation that will only serve to further entrench the big platforms; and how emerging protocols and approaches may point us towards a better future. A future in which code and regulation work hand in hand to ensure the web remains free, safe, and open to everyone.</p>
