                <h2>Data Protection &amp; Privacy Policy</h2>
                <h3>1. An overview of data protection</h3>
                <h4>General</h4>
                <p>The following gives a simple overview of what happens to your personal information when you visit our
                    website. Personal information is any data with which you could be personally identified. Detailed
                    information on the subject of data protection can be found in our privacy policy found below.</p>
                <h4>Data collection on our website</h4>
                <h5>Who is responsible for the data collection on this website?</h5>
                <p>The data collected on this website are processed by the website operator. The operator's contact
                    details can be found in the website's required <a href="site-notice.html">legal notice</a>.</p>
                <h5>How do we collect your data?</h5>
                <p>Some data are collected when you provide it to us. This could, for example, be data you enter on a
                    contact form.</p>
                <p>Other data are collected automatically by our IT systems when you visit the website. These data are
                    primarily technical data such as the browser and operating system you are using or when you accessed
                    the page. These data are collected automatically as soon as you enter our website.</p>
                <h5>What do we use your data for?</h5>
                <p>Part of the data is collected to ensure the proper functioning of the website. Other data can be used
                    to analyze how visitors use the site.</p>
                <h5>What rights do you have regarding your data?</h5>
                <p>You always have the right to request information about your stored data, its origin, its recipients,
                    and the purpose of its collection at no charge. You also have the right to request that it be
                    corrected, blocked, or deleted. You can contact us at any time using the address given in the legal
                    notice if you have further questions about the issue of privacy and data protection. You may also,
                    of course, file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.</p>
                <h3>2. General information and mandatory information</h3>
                <h4>Data protection</h4>
                <p>The operators of this website take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your
                    personal data as confidential and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and
                    this privacy policy.</p>
                <p>If you use this website, various pieces of personal data will be collected. Personal information is
                    any data with which you could be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what
                    information we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this
                    happens.</p>
                <p>Please note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g. via email communication) may be subject to
                    security breaches. Complete protection of your data from third-party access is not possible.</p>
                <h4>Notice concerning the party responsible for this website</h4>
                <p>The party responsible for processing data on this website is:</p>
                <p>tollwerk GmbH<br/>
                    Klingenhofstraße 5<br/>
                    90411 Nürnberg<br/>
                    Germany</p>

                <p>Telephone: +49 911 9593945<br/>
                    Email: info@material.is</p>
                <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the
                    purposes and means of processing personal data (names, email addresses, etc.).</p>
                <h4>Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data</h4>
                <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may revoke your
                    consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The
                    data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
                <h4>Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities</h4>
                <p>If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint
                    with the competent regulatory authorities. The competent regulatory authority for matters related to
                    data protection legislation is the data protection officer of the German state in which our company
                    is headquartered. A list of data protection officers and their contact details can be found at the
                    following link: <a
                            href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html"
                            target="_blank">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html</a>.
                </p>
                <h4>Right to data portability</h4>
                <p>You have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a
                    contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable
                    format. If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be
                    done to the extent technically feasible.</p>
                <h4>SSL or TLS encryption</h4>
                <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission
                    of confidential content, such as the inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can
                    recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to
                    "https://" and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's address bar.</p>
                <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third
                    parties.</p>
                <h4>Information, blocking, deletion</h4>
                <p>As permitted by law, you have the right to be provided at any time with information free of charge
                    about any of your personal data that is stored as well as its origin, the recipient and the purpose
                    for which it has been processed. You also have the right to have this data corrected, blocked or
                    deleted. You can contact us at any time using the address given in our legal notice if you have
                    further questions on the topic of personal data.</p>
                <h4>Opposition to promotional emails</h4>
                <p>We hereby expressly prohibit the use of contact data published in the context of website legal notice
                    requirements with regard to sending promotional and informational materials not expressly requested.
                    The website operator reserves the right to take specific legal action if unsolicited advertising
                    material, such as email spam, is received.</p>
                <h3>3. Data collection on our website</h3>
                <h4>Server log files</h4>
                <p>The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically
                    transmits to us in "server log files". These are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
                    <li>Operating system used</li>
                    <li>Referrer URL</li>
                    <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
                    <li>Time of the server request</li>
                    <li>IP address (anonymized by invalidating the last two address octets before storage)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These data will not be combined with data from other sources.</p>
                <p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill
                    a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.</p>
                <h4>Contact form</h4>
                <p>Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form,
                    including the contact details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up questions. We
                    do not share this information without your permission.</p>
                <p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art.
                    6 (1)(a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is
                    sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
                <p>We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your
                    consent for its storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling
                    your request). Any mandatory statutory provisions, especially those regarding mandatory data
                    retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.</p>
                <h3 id="newsletter">4. Newsletter</h3>
                <h4>Newsletter data</h4>
                <p>If you would like to receive our newsletter, we require a valid email address as well as information
                    that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and that you agree to
                    receive this newsletter. No additional data is collected or is only collected on a voluntary basis.
                    We only use this data to send the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>
                <p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art.
                    6 (1) (a) GDPR. You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as
                    their use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g. through the "unsubscribe" link in the
                    newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
                <p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until
                    you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted. Data we have stored for other purposes
                    (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remain unaffected.</p>
                <h4>MailChimp</h4>
                <p>This website uses the services of MailChimp to send newsletters. This service is provided by Rocket
                    Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.</p>
                <p>MailChimp is a service which organizes and analyzes the distribution of newsletters. If you provide
                    data (e.g. your email address) to subscribe to our newsletter, it will be stored on MailChimp
                    servers in the USA.</p>
                <p>MailChimp is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is an agreement between the
                    European Union (EU) and the US to ensure compliance with European privacy standards in the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>We use MailChimp to analyze our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email sent by MailChimp, a
                    file included in the email (called a web beacon) connects to MailChimp's servers in the United
                    States. This allows us to determine if a newsletter message has been opened and which links you
                    click on. In addition, technical information is collected (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address,
                    browser type, and operating system). This information cannot be assigned to a specific recipient. It
                    is used exclusively for the statistical analysis of our newsletter campaigns. The results of these
                    analyses can be used to better tailor future newsletters to your interests.</p>
                <p>If you do not want your usage of the newsletter to be analyzed by MailChimp, you will have to
                    unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter we send.
                    You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter directly on the website.</p>
                <p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent at any time by
                    unsubscribing to the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be
                    legally processed.</p>
                <p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until
                    you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted from our servers and those of MailChimp.
                    Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remains
                    unaffected.</p>
                <p>For details, see the MailChimp privacy policy at <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/"
                                                                       target="_blank">https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/</a>.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Completion of a data processing agreement</strong></p>
                <p>We have entered into a data processing agreement with MailChimp, in which we require MailChimp to
                    protect the data of our customers and not to disclose said data to third parties. This agreement may
                    be viewed at the following link: <a
                            href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/forms/data-processing-agreement/sample-agreement/"

                <h3>5. Plugins and tools</h3>
                <h4>YouTube</h4>
                <p>Our website uses plugins from YouTube, which is operated by Google. The operator of the pages is
                    YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.</p>
                <p>If you visit one of our pages featuring a YouTube plugin, a connection to the YouTube servers is
                    established. Here the YouTube server is informed about which of our pages you have visited.</p>
                <p>If you're logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube allows you to associate your browsing behavior
                    directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube
                    account.</p>
                <p>YouTube is used to help make our website appealing. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to
                    Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.</p>
                <p>Further information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of
                    YouTube under <a href="https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy</a>.
                </p>
                <h4>Google Web Fonts</h4>
                <p>For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a
                    page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts
                    correctly.</p>
                <p>For this purpose your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google servers. Google thus
                    becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is
                    done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a
                    justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.</p>
