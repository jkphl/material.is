                    <p>20+ years of the Web and we are still at the very beginning of <em>understanding and implementing
                        digitization</em>. For the first time we are facing a generation that never got to know <em>the
                        offline world</em>. By nature they are riding the wave without ever having touched the ground.
                        We might have unlearned our ancestors' knowledge about materials and crafts, it's easy to
                        overlook the <em>intrinsic characteristics of the Web</em> in favour of the newest framework or
                        boilerplate.</p>

                    <h3>Charlotte Dann — Integration of artistry to the web</h3>
                    <p><a href="http://charlottedann.com">Charlotte Dann</a> is a designer/developer based in London,
                        working across a wide spectrum of disciplines ranging from electronics to fine glasswork; she
                        has not yet found a craft she does not wish to master.</p>

                    <p>While undertaking an MA in Computational Arts she created <a href="https://hexatope.io"
                                                                                    target="_blank"

                        a combination of her two central vocations of jewellery design and web development. Hexatope
                        allows anyone to design their own jewellery by intuitively interacting with a hexagonal grid
                        entirely in the browser. Designs are then produced in precious metal using 3D-printing
                        technology and traditional metalwork.</p>

                    <p>Charlotte's going to talk about the integration of artistry to the web and how practical design
                        techniques can evolve with computational thinking.</p>

                        working at Google in London on various top secret projects as Principal Designer in Google
                        Research &amp; Machine Intelligence. Matt Jones' talk will look at some of the ideas around raw
                        computing. If the Web were a material, he'd brute force his way to the best answer, maybe
                        without even understanding how he got there — and that's OK.</p>

                    <h3>Björn Steinar</h3>
                    <p><a href="http://www.bjornsteinar.com" target="_blank">Björn Steinar</a> is an Icelandic designer
                        who takes a closer look at all the waste we produce on a daily basis. From food waste to
                        plastic, he explores ways we can do better. His most recent project, <a
                                href="http://www.bjornsteinar.com/catchoftheday" target="_blank"><cite>Catch of the
                            day</cite></a>, is fighting food waste one vodka bottle at a time.</p>
                    <p>Food waste is a severe problem on a global scale with no solution in sight due to fluctuations in
                        production and demand. Fermentation and distillation of leftover fruits prolong the “best
                        before” date to infinity; since alcohol over 23% can never go bad. Each batch is carefully
                        crafted using discarded fruits, picked up from local importers, farmers or dumpsters. </p>

                    <p>Björn will get us thinking about all the physical waste we are producing as part of the Web and
                        what we can do about it!</p>

                <h2>The Web as a material</h2>
                <p>For centuries we've worked with wood, metal, glass, ceramic, paper, textiles. More recently, new
                    materials have emerged; plastics, fiberglass, silicon, and more. We understand their limitations,
                    their affordances. We can fold, heat, manipulate and warp some of these materials. But the Internet
                    and the Web are still very new to us. We don't fully understand them as a material.</p>
                <p class="em">What does this mean for the Web? What are the properties of the Web as a Material?</p>
                <p>We have lost the apprentice / master relationship in the digital world. Spending years getting our
                    hands dirty with an expert, learning slowly and really understanding the material rather than the
                    framework. We need to be asking ourselves what sacrifices should we be making for the convenience of
                    our customers rather than shortcuts for ourselves.</p>
